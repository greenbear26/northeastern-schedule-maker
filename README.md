# Northeastern Schedule Maker

This is a Python application that helps Northeastern University students create
their class schedules. It allows users to input their desired courses and
generates possible schedules based on course availability and time slots.

In the future, we plan to add features such as inputting preferred time slots
and incorporating RateMyProfessors ratings to help students choose the best
professors for their courses.
